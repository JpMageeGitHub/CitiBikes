CitiBike Leaflet/javascript proof of concept

Exploratory small project to learn how to use Leaflet and javascript to create a map of CitiBike stations in NYC.  The map is interactive and allows the user to click on a station to see the number of bikes available at that station.  The map also shows the user's current location.
